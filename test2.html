<h2>Projects Notebook</h2>
<h3>GitHub</h3>
<p>First, try to figure out HTML on GitHub to see whether or not Markdown is totally necessary! So far, it looks like HTML is super easy on GitHub, so 
  I'm not sure what the big fuss is about using HTML on Git. For now, it seems like it's important for me to focus on perfecting HTML and worry about Markdown
  should it become something I need to learn later.</p>
<p>Operating HTML through Git will also allow me to experiment with GitHub and versioning workflows.</p>
<h3>The Victorian Jewish Writers Project</h3>
<p>Data entry is the biggest "need" for the VJWP, as well as content about Victorian Jewish writers. Thus far, the VJWP has dozens of items on "Pre-Victorian" Jewish writers in Britain and one
hastily created exhibit on Pre-Victorian Jewish writers. The VJWP needs a facelift. Because the site is built on Omeka, this will mean dramatically revising a theme or creating a new one.</p>
<h3>Mapping Tanya Project</h3>
<p>Mapping Tanya is primarily a GIS project. It's still in the formative stages. Mostly, it requires data entry given the enormous volume of data it will take to map the Tanya publications. But beyond that, 
  decisions need to be made about the end-goal of the project, particularly how it will be hosted and visualized for wider audiences. Currently, the project is a CSV file imported into a Google Map, 
  but that setup is unimaginitive and doesn't give the level of detail I'd like to see in the completed project.</p>
